# LIBRAS_training
Training a CV model for LIBRAS letter recognition.


This university project focused on training a CV model to recognize the static hand gestures representing the letters L, O, and M in LIBRAS (Brazilian Sign Language). All images are in gray scale.

The primary objective was to explore the potential of Deep Learning in CV while studying the feasibility of creating accessible devices for Deaf/Mute individuals in various service-oriented settings such as pharmacies and restaurants.

The trained model, along with the testing code and the dataset used (mostly provided by: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7314578 ), is provided in this repo.
